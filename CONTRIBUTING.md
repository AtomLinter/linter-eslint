# Contributing

## Basic Steps

If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1.  Fork the plugin repository
2.  Run `npm install` to setup all dependencies
3.  Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`
4.  Commit and push the topic branch
5.  Make a pull request
6.  Welcome to the club!

## Guidelines

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

*   Indent is 2 spaces
*   Code should pass the `eslint` linter
*   Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it

## Building

The simplest procedure is to just run `npm run watch` in a terminal. This will
launch `ucompiler` and tell it to watch the `src` directory, automatically
recompiling any file that is updated for you. If you prefer to run this step
manually, running `npm install` will also run `ucompiler go` for you.

Thank you for helping out!
