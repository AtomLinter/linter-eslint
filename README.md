linter-eslint
=========================

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to [eslint](http://eslint.org). It will be used with files that have the “JavaScript” syntax.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Plugin installation
```
$ apm install linter-eslint
```

linter-eslint will look for a version of eslint local to your project and use it if it's available. If none is found it will fall back to the version it ships with.

Lets say you depend on a specific version of eslint, maybe it has unreleased features, maybe it's just newer than what linter-eslint ships with. If `your-project/node_modules/eslint` exists linter-eslint will try to use that.

## Use with `babel-eslint`

In order to use [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) parser you need to install locally on your project `eslint` and `babel-eslint`

* `$ npm install --save-dev eslint babel-eslint`

And add a `.eslintrc` in your project directory with parser set to `babel-eslint`

```json
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint"
}
```

Alternatively, you can enable `useGlobalEslint` option and install eslint and babel-eslint globally using `npm i -g eslint babel-eslint`.

## Settings
You can configure linter-eslint by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu) or in Preferences:

```coffee
'linter-eslint':
  'eslintRulesDir': 'mydir'
  'disableWhenNoEslintrcFileInPath': true  
  'useGlobalEslint': true,
  'showRuleIdInMessage': true
```

The `eslintRulesDir` is relative to the working directory (project root).
`disableWhenNoEslintrcFileInPath` allows disabling linter-eslint when there is no `.eslintrc` file in the path.
`useGlobalEslint` allows using globally installed eslint and plugins for it.
Setting `showRuleIdInMessage` to `true` will append the eslint ruleId to warning/error messages.
